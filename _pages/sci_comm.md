I am passionate about science communication and my expertise includes using storytelling to synthesize and communicate complex scientific information for broad audiences. My expertise has not only created opportunities to interact with media, but also interface with policymakers. Most recently, I traveled to Washington DC as an invited participant for a [wildfire science communication and policy workshop organized by COMPASS and the Federation of American Scientists]( https://www.compassscicomm.org/science-at-capitol-hill-dr-jamie-peeler/). During the workshop, I received media training with journalists from the Washington Post, Politico, and Climate Central. I also arranged a meeting with Congressman Ryan Zinke’s (R-MT) and Congresswoman Kim Schrier’s (D-WA) staff to talk about the science behind prescribed fire use.

In addition to distributing my research through peer-reviewed journal articles, I focus on science delivery to land managers and science enthusiasts. For example, I have written [two]( https://theconversation.com/the-us-is-spending-billions-to-reduce-forest-fire-risks-we-mapped-the-hot-spots-where-treatment-offers-the-biggest-payoff-for-people-and-climate-210051) [news articles]( https://theconversation.com/the-wests-iconic-forests-are-increasingly-struggling-to-recover-from-wildfires-altering-how-fires-burn-could-boost-their-chances-200668) for The Conversation. My research was also featured on the [US Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station’s Science You Can Use]( https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/pubs_journals/rmrs/sycu/2024/sycu5_2024_06_burning_questions.pdf) and [Northern Rockies Fire Science Network’s Research Briefs]( https://www.nrfirescience.org/sites/default/files/NRFSN_ResearchBrief12_Seed%20Source%20Pattern%20and%20PostFire%20Recovery_Final.pdf).

While completing my PhD, I was a science communication specialist for the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences writing center at Penn State University. As part of my position, I provided one-on-one coaching, workshops, and classroom experiences to help undergraduates become better science communicators. I also co-taught a course on science communication and water resources in which each undergraduate used storytelling approaches to produce a digital story.
