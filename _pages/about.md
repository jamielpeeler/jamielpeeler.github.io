I am an applied landscape ecologist dedicated to helping forests and people adapt to a new wildfire normal. Much of my current research focuses on wildfire risk mitigation in the US West.

I was previously a [NatureNet Science Fellow](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-science/naturenet-science-fellowships/) with The Nature Conservancy and University of Montana. I received my PhD and MS in Geography from Penn State University, where I worked with Dr. Erica Smithwick in the [LEAPS lab](https://sites.psu.edu/smithwick/). At Penn State, I funded my graduate research through grants from the National Science Foundation, National Geographic, Joint Fire Science Program, and NASA.
