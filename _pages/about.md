I am an applied landscape ecologist dedicated to helping forests and people adapt to the new wildfire normal. I collaborate with land management agencies and integrate GIS, fieldwork, and spatial modeling approaches to produce actionable science that informs decision-making and solves real-world problems. My current research is funded through the Biden Administration's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and focuses on wildfire risk mitigation in the US West.

I was previously a [NatureNet Science Fellow](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-science/naturenet-science-fellowships/) with The Nature Conservancy and University of Montana. I received my PhD in Geography from Penn State University and the National Science Foundation, National Geographic, Joint Fire Science Program, and NASA funded my graduate research.
