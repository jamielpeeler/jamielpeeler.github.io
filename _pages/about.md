As a landscape ecologist with a focus on climate change mitigation and adaptation, I specialize in translating science into actionable strategies that address complex environmental challenges. I lead and support collaborative efforts that bring together diverse teams of scientists, policymakers, and stakeholders to drive impactful solutions in areas like forest management, carbon sequestration, wildfire risk, and ecosystem resilience. At the heart of my work is a commitment to backing solutions that promote healthy ecosystems and the well-being of the communities that depend on them. 

I was previously a [NatureNet Science Fellow](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-science/naturenet-science-fellowships/) with The Nature Conservancy and University of Montana. I received my PhD in Geography from Penn State University and the National Science Foundation, National Geographic, Joint Fire Science Program, and NASA funded my graduate research. My current research as a University of Montana Research Scientist and Missoula Fire Lab ORISE Fellow focuses on mitigating wildfire risk to carbon in the US West.
