As a fire and forest ecologist with a focus on climate change mitigation and adaptation, I specialize in translating science into actionable strategies that address complex environmental challenges. I lead and support risk-informed, cross-sector efforts that bring together diverse teams of scientists, policymakers, and stakeholders to drive impactful solutions in wildfire mitigation, forest management, natural climate solutions, and ecosystem resilience. At the heart of my work is a commitment to advancing solutions that promote healthy ecosystems and the well-being of the communities that depend on them.

My current work as a University of Montana Research Scientist and Missoula Fire Lab ORISE Fellow focuses on mitigating wildfire risk to carbon storage and sequestration in the US West. I was previously a [NatureNet Science Fellow](https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-science/naturenet-science-fellowships/) with The Nature Conservancy and University of Montana. I received my PhD in Geography from Penn State University and the National Science Foundation, National Geographic, Joint Fire Science Program, and NASA funded my graduate research.
