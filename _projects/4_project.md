wildfire is creating large burn sites in forests that contain few surviving trees. Surviving trees disperse seeds that are critical for burn sites to regenerate and federal land managers are mandated to re-plant in burn sites that will not recover. However, predicting which burn sites will not recover is tricky and it is unclear which arrangements of surviving trees promote recovery. To address this knowledge gap, I used aerial imagery, field data, and geospatial data from a mixed conifer forest in the Northern Rockies to investigate which arrangements of surviving trees help burn sites recover. Key findings underscored the importance of considering arrangements alongside traditional distance to seed source measures when assessing potential for post-fire tree recovery. Importantly, findings showed that burn sites required 40% of the area within a 100 m buffer to contain surviving trees for desired regeneration density to occur. But terrain also mattered at burn sites dominated by wind-dispersed tree species, with burn sites positioned above surviving trees less likely to recover naturally. As a result, burn sites may need to be prioritized for re-planting after wildfire.  
placing burned sites in the context of their surrounding
seed source pattern could be fundamental to decisionmaking. It could also help prioritize which burned
sites to devote effort, time, and money
