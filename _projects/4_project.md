This project underscores the importance of considering seed source patterns alongside traditional distance measures when assessing post-fire tree recovery. By exploring these spatial dynamics, we contribute valuable insights to ecological research and forest management practices, aiming to promote sustainable conservation efforts in mountainous regions.

This project was funded by the National Science Foundation, National Geographic, Joint Fire Science Program, and NASA.
