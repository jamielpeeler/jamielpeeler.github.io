Key findings underscored the importance of considering seed source patterns alongside traditional distance measures when assessing potential for post-fire tree recovery. By exploring these spatial dynamics alongside the impact of complex terrain, we contribute valuable insights to ecological research and forest management practices, aiming to promote sustainable conservation efforts in mountainous regions. To meet these two objectives,
placing burned sites in the context of their surrounding
seed source pattern could be fundamental to decisionmaking. It could also help prioritize which burned
sites to devote effort, time, and money
