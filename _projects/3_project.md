I am an invited participant to a interdisciplinary working group for the [Morpho Initiative](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/news/fire-and-flight-announcing-first-morpho-working-groups) at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis. Our working group represents academic institutions, US Forest Service, USGS, and Colorado Department of Natural Resources and holds expertise in wildfire mitigation, carbon stability, ecosystem services, econometrics approaches, social media analytics, and mountain limnology. Collectively, we are assessing the effectiveness of using prescribed burning to mitigate wildfire risks to carbon sequestration, water yield, and recreation in California and Colorado.
