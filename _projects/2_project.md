Using a robust framework, I assess how wildfire hazard interacts with carbon exposure and vulnerability across the region. Through this analysis, I identify strategic opportunity areas where proactive forest management can effectively reduce the risk of carbon loss caused by wildfires.

Key findings highlight California, New Mexico, and Arizona as regions with significant carbon vulnerability to wildfire impacts relative to their forest areas. Moreover, my research underscores widespread opportunities throughout the western US for implementing proactive strategies that simultaneously protect carbon stocks and local communities from wildfire risks.
