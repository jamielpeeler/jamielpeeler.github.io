I recently worked with collaborators at The Nature Conservancy, USFS Rocky Mountain Research Station, and University of Montana to synthesize heterogenous spatial data into an index that mapped where opportunities to reduce wildfire-caused carbon loss occur in the US West. Using a comprehensive framework, I analyze the interplay between wildfire hazard, carbon exposure, and vulnerability to identify strategic areas for intervention. Key findings highlight California, New Mexico, and Arizona as particularly vulnerable regions where proactive management could significantly mitigate carbon loss risks relative to their forest coverage. The research underscores widespread opportunities across the western US to implement effective strategies that safeguard both carbon stocks and local communities from wildfire impacts. 

Importantly, these findings were included in the US Forest Service Climate Risk Viewer and briefed to the USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment and the US Forest Service Chief. The US Forest Service Chief noted that the findings would be “key in informing our overall efforts to address the wildfire crisis facing our nation’s forests by doing the right work, in the right place, at the right time.”
