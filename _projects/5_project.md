I used field data, gesopatial data, and spatial modeling approaches to [investigate wildfire-forest-cheatgrass dynamics in low elevation forests](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ddi.12765). Key findings included that high-severity fire increased potential cheatgrass distribution when forest canopy cover was reduced to below 30%. Consequently, high-severity wildfire increased the total area susceptible to invasion in low elevation forests â€” allowing cheatgrass to expand into previously unsuitable sites. At the time, wildfire-forest-cheatgrass dynamics were an understudied subject and increasing our understanding of them remains critical for mitigating habitat degredation, stabilizing carbon storage, and supporting native biodiversity.
